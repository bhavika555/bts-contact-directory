# 📞 Contact Manager App

A simple and useful web application to manage phone contacts. This project was built to practice my frontend development skills, specifically handling forms and displaying lists.

## 📝 About The Project

I built this app to solve a simple problem: keeping track of contact details. Recently, I updated the app to include a fully functional **Add Contact** feature, allowing users to input names and numbers which are then displayed dynamically on the screen.

### Features
* **Add New Contacts:** Users can enter a Name and Phone Number.
* **Dynamic List:** The contact list updates immediately after adding a new person.
* **Input Validation:** Ensures you can't add an empty contact.
* **Responsive Layout:** Looks good on mobile and desktop screens.

## 💻 Technologies Used

* **HTML5** - For the structure of the app.
* **CSS3** - For styling and layout.
* **JavaScript** - For the logic (handling the "Add" button and updating the list).

## 🧠 What I Learned

Building this project helped me understand:
* How to grab values from input fields using JavaScript.
* How to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to add new HTML elements dynamically.
* How to deploy a website so others can use it.
